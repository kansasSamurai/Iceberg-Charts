This is a message to myself 5-6 years into the future when I have completely forgotten how I set this project up.

In order to push the project into the nexus repository you need to run maven deploy like so :

#mvn clean deploy

However when doing this a settings file is required. Running it just like that will create an error.

You need to specify the settings file in the eclipse run config for the project. This contains the username and password for the nexus repository. 
Which is why i am not committing it to the github project. It is in my dev folder in my cloud drive.

The GPG plugin associates my email address (i think) with this project and knows how to sign the artifacts before sending them up to sonatype.
